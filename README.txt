#CustomModuleBuilder

This is a powershell module used to create a basic structure for powershell modules. The product you see here is based on the work of Kevin Marquette (https://www.youtube.com/user/ithinkincode) on his "Pester in action" series and his "Quick and Dirty Powershell modules" video.
